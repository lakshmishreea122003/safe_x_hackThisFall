## Challenges I ran into
- Building Safe_X‚Äîa social media platform that‚Äôs safe and empowering for women‚Äîwas a dream project for me, but it came with its fair share of challenges. Its basically a simulation of a safer version of X.
One of the biggest hurdles was working with the X (formerly Twitter) API. As a free user, I faced tight access limits, frequent "429 Too Many Requests" errors, and several restricted endpoints. This was frustrating because my vision of a safer social media space for women depended on pulling in real-time data to analyze and flag harmful content. Without the budget for the paid API tiers, I had to carefully manage my requests, optimize calls, and test strategies to avoid hitting the rate limits, all while staying within the free access constraints.
- The design was another challenge. Using Streamlit to build the interface posed some limitations, as I wanted the app to mirror the familiar look and feel of the X app. Streamlit wasn‚Äôt as flexible as a full-stack framework, so I had to get creative to replicate the smooth, dynamic experience users expect. This involved experimenting with custom styles and components, balancing simplicity with functionality to make the app intuitive and visually appealing.
- Finally, getting tweets processed‚Äîfetching data, classifying content with ML and AI, and storing the results in a database‚Äîwas time-consuming. At first, this led to noticeable wait times for users. Reducing these delays required refining the code, optimizing database queries, and exploring ways to streamline data handling, all while keeping the app responsive.
Through each challenge, I learned the importance of resilience and problem-solving. Safe_X has been a labor of love, bringing me closer to my vision of a social media platform that prioritizes safety and support for women.
